Face recognition technology has widely attracted attention due to its enormous application value and market potential. It is being implemented in various fields like security systems, digital video processing, and many such technological advances. Additionally, music is the form of art, which is known to have a greater connection with a person’s emotion.

It has got a unique ability to lift up one’s mood. Relatively, this paper focuses on building an efficient music recommendation system which determines the emotion of user using Facial Recognition techniques. The algorithm implemented would prove to be more proficient than the existing systems. Moreover, on a larger dimension, this would render salvage of time and labour invested in performing the process manually. The overall concept the system is to recognize facial emotions and recommend songs efficiently. The proposed system will be both time and cost efficient. This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks and recommend songs to users which is never a definite prediction. Face recognition is one of the challenging process due to huge number of wild datasets. Deep learning has been provided good solution in terms of recognition performance, and many such technological advances.
